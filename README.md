## Issue Reproduction Instructions for biomejs-website#662

Here’s a step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue:

1. Observe the configurations in biome.json[overrides]. Notice that dir-1/b.ts is set to ignore the lint/style/useImportType rule, meaning it should not be linted. Contrastingly, dir-2/d.ts is expected to be linted, as it uses type imports from dir-2/c.ts.
2. Execute npm run check. After running this command:
	• The file dir-1/b.ts should remain unchanged.
	• The file dir-2/d.ts will be modified to include type imports, as expected.
3. Reset all changes. Then, add some new lines in both dir-1/b.ts and dir-2/d.ts so that the files show modifications and are staged for commit. Commit these changes. After the commit, unexpectedly, dir-1/b.ts will be linted and import type will be added.
4. Reset all changes again. Add new lines in dir-1/b.ts and dir-2/d.ts. Then, modify lefthook.yml by uncommenting the root line. Commit these changes. After this commit, you will observe:
	• The file dir-1/b.ts is not linted, aligning with the expectations.

By following these steps, the inconsistent linting behavior can be experienced and confirmed.
